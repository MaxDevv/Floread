# FloRead

FloRead is a modern, web-based speed reading application designed to help users read text at high speeds while maintaining comprehension and enjoyment.

## Overview

FloRead transforms the traditional reading experience by displaying one sentence at a time with smooth animations, helping readers maintain focus and increase their reading speed. Unlike conventional word-by-word speed readers that can be jarring and difficult to follow, FloRead uses a sentence-based approach that provides better context and a more natural reading flow.

## Features

- **Sentence-Based Reading**: Text is displayed one sentence at a time with smooth transitions
- **Adjustable Reading Speed**: Control your reading pace from 50 to 700 words per minute
- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple interface with play/pause and navigation buttons
- **Smart Pacing**: Automatically adjusts timing based on sentence length
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, distraction-free interface with a dark theme
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indication of your position in the text

## How It Works

1. Paste your text into the application
2. Adjust your desired reading speed using the WPM slider
3. Press play to begin reading
4. Use the navigation buttons to move forward or backward through the text
5. Pause at any time to reflect on what you've read

## Why FloRead?

The average person reads 200-300 words per minute, but with the right techniques, you could reach up to 700 WPM. That's an entire novel in just over an hour!

FloRead brings you a simple, organized experience designed to work with your brain. Our smooth, animated display shows you one sentence at a time, keeping you focused and engaged.

No more jumbled pages, flipping back and forth, or losing focus. With FloRead, you can tackle long documents, books, and papers in minutes while actually enjoying it.

## Future Plans

- Reading sessions with breaks to prevent fatigue
- Progress tracking with line counts and time estimates
