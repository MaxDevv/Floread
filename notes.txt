    - I think reading at such high speeds consistently is a lil too hard, so I think the system should break reading up into "sessions" oooh and in the seessioons we could add a timer or no even better a line count to show the user how many lines theey have left, and at the end of each session we could force/have the user summarize what they learnt in at least 10 words, and itd be great cuz not only would it help the user reemrmber better, but it'd give them personalized notes they could reefer back to when needed

I just came up with the perfect ad: 2-May-2025

    And not just that but what if it was fun, engaging, and actually

    The primary purpose of the website is to help users we text at high speeds and enjoy doing so
    The target audience should be students who might need to read and studying large amount of text
    On most readers on the market are very low quality i'm going to call for sentence base reading like the only offer word by word popup reading which is very flickery and thier UI is pretty bad, And none of them gamify the reading  process, my program on the other hand will be animated it will use sentences will be smooth and much more enjoyable to use it's for allow users to see previous and future sentences
    This will be focused on reading speed and enjoyability
    The reading material will be entirely up to the user
    And gingers will be able to track the amount of time reading and words read
    The time pressure will be implemented the use of animations like the text will be scrolling and this is really good cuz it gives the user or a granular feel of how much time they have per sentence
    There will not be penalties or adaptations however the sentence speed and duration of showing will slightly adapt depending on the character length of the sentence
    If will have a dark theme
    User interface will be very sleek and minimalist however the animations will be smooth and rich
    It is not really designed for people with the reading imparements but can assist
    It's not going to need some scalability it's just going to be a piece of software designed once and to be used.
    The platform success will be measured by the amount of text read by the users.
